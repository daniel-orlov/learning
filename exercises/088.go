This exercise will reinforce our understanding of method sets:

create a type person struct
attach a method speak to type person using a pointer receiver
		*person

create a type human interface
		to implicitly implement the interface,
		a human must have the speak method

create func “saySomething”
		have it take in a human as a parameter
		have it call the speak method

show the following in your code
		you CAN pass a value of type *person into saySomething
		you CANNOT pass a value of type person into saySomething
