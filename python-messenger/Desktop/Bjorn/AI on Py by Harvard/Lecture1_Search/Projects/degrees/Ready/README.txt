Hi!

My name is Daniel and I am fairly new to python.
My apologies for I could not quite figure out how to add time-saving check mechanism,
that retrieves target the moment it is added to frontier.
I am sorry if I screwed sth while pushing the files too.

Thank you very much for this course, I am very excited to learn more.

Stay safe!
