> Welcome to my litle playground, where I learn mobile app development on Android.

I believe it is best to start learning anything with a solid reason, a _"why"_ that will be your motivation in a moment of frustration or doubt.

My _"why"_ behind learning how to create mobile apps (and learning to code, in general) is pretty simple:

I believe that breaking down global threats into small problems and solving them step by step is one of the possible ways to ensure we are taking a set of actions that are most likely to result in a better future for all of us.
And programming has already proven to be an effective tool to reshape the reality and make a large-scale impact with (relatively) small efforts.
