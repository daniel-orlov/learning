# Learning

This repository contains the notes and code for the courses I have taken, books I have read, and other resources I have used to learn.
My _"why"_ behind learning how to code is pretty simple:

I believe that breaking down global threats into small problems and solving them step by step is one of the possible ways to ensure we are taking a set of actions that are most likely to result in a better future for all of us.
And programming has already proven to be an effective tool to reshape the reality and make a large-scale impact with (relatively) small efforts.
